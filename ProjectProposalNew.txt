Main Goal/Results of the project:
	Underwater Image Enhancement.

Problem Definition:
  Due to the absorption and scattering of light in underwater environment,underwater images have poor contrast and resolution.
  In the associated research paper they are trying to enhance the image by contrast stretching each of RGB channels seperately.
  The best parameters for this contrast stretching are determined using an optimization problem. Here in the paper it assumed 
  that the sum of image entropy and avergae gradient should be maximum(objective function) for the clearer image. Thus the best 
  parameters used in constrast stretching are those which maximize this sum. Here the optimization is done by using Differential
  Evolution Algorithm. Final enhanced image is obtained after sharpening this image.
