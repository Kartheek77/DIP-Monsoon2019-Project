## Install Dependencies

- Install virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper   
  `sudo pip3 install virtualenv virtualenvwrapper`  
  
- Create a UWIE Virtual environment and activate it   
  `mkvirtualenv UWIE`   
  `workon UWIE`  

- Install required Python Packages   
  `pip3 install -r requiremnts.txt`
 
 ## Usage   
 - Contrast Stretching Generally Require (r1,s1) and (r2,s2) as the input
 - Here r1, r2 are determined by the Differential Evolution algorithm as specified in the research paper. s1 and s2 are our choice.
 - We tried Two models,
 - In `Model1` we set s1 = 0 and s2 = 255
 - In 'Model2' s1 and s2 are also considered as variables and will be determined by DE Algo
 - In 'Model3' Objective Function is changed to Entropy + Variance (within Lower and Upper Limits) 
 - UWIEf_MODEL1.ipynb implements Model1 on the Images Given in the associated research paper. It takes input from the PaperImages Folder and displays the given and enhanced Images in the Notebook Itself.
 - UWIEf_MODEL2.py implements Models2. As more number of variable are involved in optimization problem. This need multiprocessing. Thus this file is ran on ADA. This file takes input from PaperImages and outputs the enhanced images. The Folder Model2_UWIE_OutputImages contain the images enhanced by this method. Model2_UWIE_Output.txt file contains the shell output while running on ADA
 -
 - The folder TurbidityDataSetInputImages contains [images](http://amandaduarte.com.br/turbid/turbid/Milk.zip) used in the [Research paper](http://amandaduarte.com.br/turbid/Turbid_Dataset.pdf).
 - The folder EnhancedAndGivenImagesTurbidDataSetUsingOriginalMethod contains the results of running the Original Algo On these Images. Both Given and Enhanced Images are put for comparision.
 - Open UWIEf.ipynb for UWIE algorithm.
 - To create SMCSVM object use:   
   `clf = SMCSVM()`
 
 - Pass training data and trainng labels to fit() func'tion to train the classifier.   
   `clf.fit(train_X_data, train_y_label)`   
 
 - You can also pass folowing parameters:
    
    1. C, default_value, C=10 - Penalizing factor for Slack  
    2. kernel, default value, kernel='rbf', can also take - 'linear', 'polynomial'  for utilizing kernel tricks on Non-Linear data.   
    3. sigma, default_value=1.0, required for 'RBF' kernel.
    4. degree, default_value=1, degree of polynomial function used in 'polynomial' kernel.
 - To predict on testing data use:    
   `clf.predict(test_X_data)`
 - The algorithm uses K-fold cross validation as a performance metric.
 
 
 ## Run tests
 
 - To run tests, run the run_tests.ipynb file in tests directory
